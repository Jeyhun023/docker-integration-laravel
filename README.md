# Docker Integration for Laravel Applications

This product provides a robust and convenient Docker integration setup for Laravel applications. It includes configuration for PHP, Nginx, MySQL, and Redis, ensuring a comprehensive and seamless Docker experience for Laravel developers. With this setup, you can effortlessly containerize your Laravel application, ensuring consistency across different environments and platforms, while also simplifying the deployment process.

The docker-compose.yml file orchestrates the build and linking of various service containers necessary for a typical Laravel application. The Nginx container serves your application, forwarding PHP requests to the PHP-FPM container, and static file requests to the filesystem. The MySQL container handles the database needs of your application, and Redis is set up for caching and other in-memory datastore needs.

### How to Use:
Place the provided files in the appropriate directories in your Laravel application.

Use ``docker-compose up`` to build and start the containers.

Your Laravel application should now be accessible at ``localhost:8000``.

#docker, #devops, #nginx, #redis, #laravel
